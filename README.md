Introduction
------------

My OpenAI - gym projects using Python Machine Learning.  (sklearn)


Compile and installation
------------------------

Follow instructions on https://gym.openai.com/docs to Download Gym, Download pip modules and to get execute instructions.




Testing
-------

Carl_ml.py works really well. It's able to balance the pole very quickly.
Pendulum_ml.py still needs a bit of work. With better feedback, I believe
the ml libraries will predict better.
